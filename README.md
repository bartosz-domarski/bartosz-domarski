##### The vBetFinder.com project is private and the source code is not available for viewing. Below is a description of how the software works and the libraries used in it.

## vBetFinder.com - Scanner for valuebets, surebets, and system bets for over 40 bookmakers worldwide on Discord.
### This scanner searches for:

- **Valuebets** - bets for which the expected value of the winnings is greater than 1, which means that they are profitable in the long run.
- **Surebets** - bets that are always profitable regardless of the outcome.
- **System bets** - bets based on specific betting systems.

#### The scanner has been programmed to meet strict mathematical requirements so that every given bet is profitable. The software is constantly being improved and new features are being added.
